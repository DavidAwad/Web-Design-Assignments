<h3> "Lorem Ipsum </h3>

<p>dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
   magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo

   Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum." <p>

<p> a beautiful poem indeed, the following is an actual translation from roughly the year 1914, from a <strong>Mr. H. Rackham,</strong>

<br>

"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
 born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
 great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
 avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
 pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
 loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
 circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
  which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
  has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
  or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
