# Web-Design-Assignments
Small Repo for my Web Design Class, no need to be private, might help someone. 
This is basically my personal repo and some notes.

So the current version of this site will be available at http://studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu/class-2015-1-04-547-320-03/ada80/index.html



instructions for uploading. 

download an SFTP client. give it a host of `sftp://studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu`

with a directory of `/www/studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu/htdocs/class-2015-1-04-547-320-03/your_RU_NetID`

and lastly give it a username and credentials like you would anything else.
